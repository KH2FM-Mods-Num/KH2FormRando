# KH2FormRando

Beta KH2 Form Rando

All forms includin base sora are randomized. To rerandomize run Randomize.exe from the installed mod location.
To easily get to it click on KH2FormRando in the mod manager and hit mods open mod folder.

If using the Randomize.exe
Base sora can only be regular Sora, Wisdom Form, Limit Form, or Anti Form.

If using Anti_Wont_Replace_Base
Then Anti form cannot be base sora. This is cause there are a few RCs that require a keybalde to hit the object to work. If Anti is base this can be gotten around by using a form but if you dont want to have to deal with that use this .exe

Everything else is fully random. Form exp requirements stay vanilla. EX: if base sora replaes final have fun leveling up final as base sora.
