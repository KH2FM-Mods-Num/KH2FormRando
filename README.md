# KH2FormRando

Credits since they cant be in the mod.yml easily 
Thanks to 1234567890num for making the program to actually randomize it since I dont know how to make anything other than a console application. Also continuing to improve it and add everything the .exe can do. All file edits initially done by me. Thanks to DA for the knowledge by doing an Anti Form mod first. Also thanks to Zurph from the openkh discord again since anytime I have a question he always has an easy answer.

KH2 Form Rando

Read known issues for a few precautions as to not freeze/crash. Its pretty stable but there are like two game breaking (Freezing/Crashing) Bugs.

If Base Sora is replaced by limit form dont change your keyblades outside of pride lands, the GoA, or Space Parinoids it might freeze otherwise.
There still is some tposing in forms on bosses you normally wouldnt but I only encountered one on Saix when I went into valor which was base Sora. That also could be because I use an HD patch

All forms including base sora are randomized. To rerandomize run Randomize.exe or Anti_Wont_Replace_Base.exe from the installed mod location.
To easily get to it click on KH2FormRando in the mod manager and hit mods open mod folder.

If using the Randomize.exe
Base sora can only be regular Sora, Wisdom Form, Limit Form, or Anti Form.

If using Anti_Wont_Replace_Base.exe
Then Anti form cannot be base sora. This is cause there are a few RCs that require a keybalde to hit the object to work. If Anti is base this can be gotten around by using a form but if you dont want to have to deal with that use this .exe

Everything else is fully random. Form exp requirements stay vanilla(So in whatever replaced limit form you still need to use limits to level it). EX: if base sora replaes final have fun leveling up final as base sora.



**Nothing Below this line matters anymore but im not removing it**

~~Unfortunately if you want a keyblade when using limits in limit form assuming it didnt become anti you will have to "uncomment" four lines at the bottom of the mod.yml
Depending on which form replaces limit to keep that forms keyblade when using the limit you have to delete the hastags before 4 lines. Each set of lines has a "Title" telling you which form it is for. To determine which form replaced limit before starting you must open the obj.yml and scroll all the way to the bottom and you will see which form replaced it. Next to AnimationName: ignore the extra _LIMIT after each one~~

~~P_EX100.mset is Base Sora~~

~~P_EX100_BTLF.mset is Valor Sora~~

~~P_EX100_TRIF.mset is Master Sora~~

~~P_EX100_ULTF.mset is Final Sora~~

~~P_EX100_KH1F.mset you do not need to do anything to the mod.yml~~

~~P_EX100_MAGF.mset
Wisodm will be updated not to replace wisdom form if it is wisdom I recommend ReRandomizing for now.~~

~~P_EX100_HTLF.mset
Anti doesnt have a keyblade so.~~

~~After a seed/before doing another one you will need to recomment the four lines with one # per line. also be careful not to delete any extra spaces as .ymls are dumb and are very specific~~
