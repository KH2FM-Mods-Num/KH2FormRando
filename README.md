KH2FormRando

Credits since they cant be in the mod.yml easily 
Thanks to 1234567890num for making the program to actually randomize it since I dont know how to make anything other than a console application. Also continuing to improve it and add everything the .exe can do. All file edits initially done by me. Thanks to DA for the knowledge by doing an Anti Form mod first. Also thanks to Zurph from the openkh discord again since anytime I have a question he always has an easy answer.

PC/PCSX 99.9% Stable

Read known issues for a few precautions as to not freeze/crash. Its pretty stable but there is one crash on PCSX/PC then 3 PC specific Limit Form Bugs

There may be some limited Tposing that still exists

All forms including base sora are randomized. To rerandomize run Randomize.exe or Anti_Wont_Replace_Base.exe from the installed mod location.
To easily get to it click on KH2FormRando in the mod manager and hit mods open mod folder.

If using the Randomize.exe
Base sora can only be regular Sora, Wisdom Form, Limit Form, or Anti Form.

If using Anti_Wont_Replace_Base.exe
Then Anti form cannot be base sora. This is cause there are a few RCs that require a keybalde to hit the object to work. If Anti is base this can be gotten around by using a form but if you dont want to have to deal with that use this .exe

Everything else is fully random. Form exp requirements stay vanilla(So in whatever replaced limit form you still need to use limits to level it). EX: if base sora replaes final have fun leveling up final as base sora.
