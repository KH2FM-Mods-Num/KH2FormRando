# KH2FormRando

Beta KH2 Form Rando

All forms including base sora are randomized. To rerandomize run Randomize.exe or Anti_Wont_Replace_Base.exe from the installed mod location.
To easily get to it click on KH2FormRando in the mod manager and hit mods open mod folder.

If using the Randomize.exe
Base sora can only be regular Sora, Wisdom Form, Limit Form, or Anti Form.

If using Anti_Wont_Replace_Base.exe
Then Anti form cannot be base sora. This is cause there are a few RCs that require a keybalde to hit the object to work. If Anti is base this can be gotten around by using a form but if you dont want to have to deal with that use this .exe

Everything else is fully random. Form exp requirements stay vanilla(So in whatever replaced limit form you still need to use limits to level it). EX: if base sora replaes final have fun leveling up final as base sora.

Unfortunately if you want a keyblade when using limits in limit form assuming it didnt become anti you will have to "uncomment" four lines at the bottom of the mod.yml
Depending on which form replaces limit to keep that forms keyblade when using the limit you have to delete the hastags before 4 lines. Each set of lines has a "Title" telling you which form it is for. To determine which form replaced limit before starting you must open the obj.yml and scroll all the way to the bottom and you will see which form replaced it. Next to AnimationName: ignore the extra _LIMIT after each one

P_EX100.mset is Base Sora
P_EX100_BTLF.mset is Valor Sora
P_EX100_TRIF.mset is Master Sora
P_EX100_ULTF.mset is Final Sora
P_EX100_KH1F.mset you do not need to do anything to the mod.yml

P_EX100_MAGF.mset
Wisodm will be updated not to replace wisdom form if it is wisdom I recommend ReRandomizing for now.

P_EX100_HTLF.mset
Anti doesnt have a keyblade so.
