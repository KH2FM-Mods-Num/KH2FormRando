Limit Form over Base Sora takes extra memory so do not cahnge your keyblade unless in Pride Lands, Space Parinoids, or GoA it might crash otherwise.

Dying on PC I think crashes your game cause there is no death animation I'll try to fix this soon and remove this note.

There is still some limited T-posing on boses i've only experienced one and that was probably because I use an HD patch.

While Antiform if it replaces limit form can use limits there is no keyblade so its specifically to level limit form up.

Other forms have a keyblades but ragnaroks finisher will have the wrong particle effect and will expire much quicker than usual. This specific limit is to level up limit form but the other three limits work fine.

Not really an issue but if AntiForm replaces base sora he doesn't have a keyblade so very few required RCs will be not doable without another form. This is why there is two randomize options but you would have to be really unlucky to have all forms behind Oogie, PR Barrels, and TR Boat Pete.
