If a form with less than 2 keyblades replaces Final Form do not use Fire or Blizzard it will freeze the game.

Aparantly if Master form is replaced by anti form you cannot open chests in master form. DONT DO THAT.

If base Sora is Limit Form or Wisdom Form you can only revert once from a form without going through a load zone. So if youre fighting noraml lxuord then fail the game/DM I think you lose/are softlocked and need to die. Going through a load zone fixes this after the first revert.

If on PC and Limit form is not vanilla do not use Ars Arcanum when the limit ends you will crash. Whether you use the finisher or stop early.

There is still some limited T-posing on boses i've only experienced one and that was probably because I use an HD patch.

While Antiform if it replaces limit form can use limits there is no keyblade so its specifically to level limit form up.

Other forms have a keyblades but ragnaroks finisher will have the wrong particle effect and will expire much quicker than usual. This specific limit is to level up limit form but the other three limits work fine.

Not really an issue but if AntiForm replaces base sora he doesn't have a keyblade so very few required RCs will be not doable without another form. This is why there is two randomize options but you would have to be really unlucky to have all forms behind Oogie, PR Barrels, and TR Boat Pete.
