Known Bugs

Apparantly if a form that normally has two keyblades is replaced by anti form you cannot open chests. DONT DO THAT.

If Base sora is anti form certain limits never end leaving you invincible normally this is to your benefit but in fights such as xigbar where he teleports away and waits for you to be "vulnerable" this is a softlock. To my knowledge donalds limits are fine but goofys are not. idk about other party members.

It has been brought to my attention that its not just Ars but depends on which form replaces limit form certain limits wont work.
According to Zurph on the openkh discord
-Master form strike raid finisher crashed, but cancelling early didn't.
-Final form ars crashed, regardless of when you stop using it.
-Anti form ragnarok crashed

There is still some limited T-posing on boses i've only experienced one and that was probably because I use an HD patch.

Known "issues"

While Antiform if it replaces limit form can use limits there is no keyblade so its specifically to level limit form up.

Other forms have a keyblades but ragnaroks finisher will have the wrong particle effect and will expire much quicker than usual. This specific limit is to level up limit form but the other three limits work fine.

Not really an issue but if AntiForm replaces base sora he doesn't have a keyblade so very few required RCs will be not doable without another form. This is why there is two randomize options but you would have to be really unlucky to have all forms behind Oogie, PR Barrels, and TR Boat Pete.
